# Offline Submission Backend Implementation Summary

## ✅ FINAL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### MAJOR UPDATE: ZIP-BASED UPLOAD SYSTEM

The offline submission system has been **completely refactored** from an array-based approach to a **zip file upload system** for better performance, security, and user experience.

### Backend Components Updated

1. **Schema Completely Refactored (`offline-submission.schema.ts`)**
   - **REMOVED**: Array-based `submissions` field from DTO
   - **ADDED**: Zip-based upload schemas:
     - `submissionManifestSchema` - for optional manifest.json
     - `submissionFileContentSchema` - for individual submission files
   - **UPDATED**: DTOs to support multipart/form-data with zip upload
   - **FIXED**: Removed duplicate class definitions

2. **Controller Updated (`student-exams.controller.ts`)**
   - **ADDED**: `@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('submissionsZip'))` for file upload
   - **UPDATED**: Endpoint to accept multipart/form-data with zip file
   - **ADDED**: File validation (zip type checking, required file validation)
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Proper TypeScript interface for uploaded files
   - **REMOVED**: All references to old array-based processing

3. **Service Layer Completely Refactored (`offline-submission.service.ts`)**
   - **REMOVED**: Old `processOfflineSubmissions` method (array-based)
   - **ADDED**: `extractSubmissionsFromZip` - zip extraction and parsing
   - **ADDED**: `processOfflineSubmissionsFromZip` - main entry point
   - **ADDED**: `processDecryptedSubmissions` - shared processing logic
   - **IMPLEMENTED**: Full zip handling using `yauzl` library
   - **MAINTAINED**: All existing functionality (decryption, cheat detection, scoring)

4. **Dependencies Added**
   - `yauzl` + `@types/yauzl` for zip file handling
   - `@nestjs/platform-express` + `multer` + `@types/multer` for file uploads
   - All properly installed and configured

### Cheat Detection Features Implemented

#### 🔍 **Answer Hash Verification**
- SHA-256 hash verification of answer integrity
- Answer canonicalization for consistent hashing
- Detects tampering with submission data
- **Impact**: +30 suspicious points if failed

#### ⏰ **Timestamp Integrity Analysis**
- Chronological timestamp validation
- Detection of time manipulation attempts
- Identification of suspicious gaps (>30 minutes)
- **Impact**: +25 points for manipulation, +10 for long gaps

#### 📊 **Mass Change Detection**
- Analyzes percentage of answers changed between submissions
- Flags >50% changes as highly suspicious
- Detects rapid mass changes (>30% in <2 minutes)
- **Impact**: +15 points for mass changes, +20 for rapid changes

#### 🔄 **Auto-save Pattern Analysis**
- Monitors submission intervals for irregularities
- Expected: ~30 seconds (auto-save frequency)
- Flags intervals >35 seconds as potentially suspicious
- **Impact**: +10 points for irregular patterns

#### 💤 **Inactivity Period Detection**
- Identifies long periods with no answer changes
- Multiple unchanged periods indicate potential issues
- Helps detect exam abandonment or technical problems
- **Impact**: +5 points for long inactive periods

### Suspicious Level Scoring System

| Risk Level | Score Range | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Low** | 0-20 | Normal submission pattern |
| **Medium** | 21-40 | Some irregularities detected |
| **High** | 41-70 | Multiple suspicious patterns |
| **Very High** | 71-100 | Severe anomalies detected |

### Security Features

#### 🔐 **Encryption & Decryption**
- RSA-OAEP decryption for submission keys
- AES-256-GCM decryption for sealed answers
- Private key management with environment/file fallback

#### 🛡️ **Data Integrity**
- Answer canonicalization ensures consistent hashing
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- Submission ID tracking prevents duplicates

#### 🔒 **Access Control**
- JWT authentication required
- Student role verification
- Session ownership validation

## 🔄 Processing Flow

### 1. Submission Reception
```typescript
POST /exams/student/submit-offline
{
  examId: "uuid",
  examCode: "EXAM2025001",
  submissions: [/* encrypted submissions */],
  examStartTime: "2025-07-13T10:00:00Z",
  examEndTime: "2025-07-13T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Validation & Decryption
- Verify exam exists and user enrollment
- Decrypt submission keys using RSA private key
- Decrypt sealed answers using AES-256-GCM
- Handle partial failures gracefully

### 3. Cheat Detection Analysis
- Run all 5 cheat detection algorithms
- Calculate suspicious level (0-100)
- Generate detailed anomaly descriptions
- Log all analysis steps for debugging

### 4. Answer Combination & Scoring
- Combine multiple submissions into final answers
- Calculate exam score using basic algorithm
- Store results in database with full audit trail

### 5. Response Generation
```typescript
{
  sessionId: "session-uuid",
  submissionId: "submission-uuid",
  score: 85.5,
  suspiciousLevel: 15,
