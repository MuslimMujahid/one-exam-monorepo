# Offline Exam Submission Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
This implementation provides backend support for uploading and processing offline exam submissions as encrypted zip files. The system handles RSA+AES hybrid encryption, decryption, data integrity verification, and cheat detection.

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. Zip-Based Upload API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/exams/:examId/offline-submission`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Parameters**:
  - `metadata`: JSON containing submission metadata
  - `submissionZip`: Encrypted zip file containing submissions

### 2. Hybrid Encryption Support
- **RSA Encryption**: OAEP with SHA-256 for submission key encryption
- **AES Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for answer data encryption
- **Format**: Client outputs hex-encoded data, backend decodes as hex

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Receive multipart/form-data with zip file
2. **Extract**: Extract encrypted submissions from zip using yauzl
3. **Decrypt**: RSA decrypt submission key, then AES decrypt answers
4. **Verify**: Validate answer hashes and data integrity
5. **Analyze**: Perform cheat detection analysis
6. **Store**: Save single combined submission record

### 4. Security Features
- RSA key pair verification
- Data integrity checks via SHA-256 hashes
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Encrypted data validation

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Backend Core Files
- `apps/core-backend/src/app/exams/offline-submission.service.ts` - Main service logic
- `apps/core-backend/src/app/exams/offline-submission.schema.ts` - API schemas
- `apps/core-backend/src/app/exams/student-exams.controller.ts` - Controller endpoints

### Encryption Keys
- `apps/core-backend/src/keys/private.pem` - Backend private key
- `apps/core-backend/src/keys/public.pem` - Backend public key
- `apps/student-client-electron/src/keys/public.pem` - Client public key (synchronized)

### Test Files
- `test-crypto-compatibility.js` - RSA/AES compatibility tests
- `test-offline-submission-flow.js` - End-to-end flow simulation
- `generate-keys.js` - Key generation and synchronization utility

## üîë Encryption Specifications

### RSA Configuration
```javascript
// Encryption (client-side)
crypto.publicEncrypt({
    key: publicKey,
    padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
    oaepHash: 'sha256'
}, submissionKey)

// Decryption (backend)
crypto.privateDecrypt({
    key: privateKey,
    padding: crypto.constants.RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING,
    oaepHash: 'sha256'
}, encryptedKey)
```

### AES Configuration
```javascript
// Format: "iv:ciphertext:authTag" (all hex-encoded)
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);
const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);
```

## üß™ Testing Completed

### Compatibility Tests ‚úÖ
- RSA encryption/decryption round-trip
- AES encryption/decryption with hex encoding
- Key pair verification and synchronization

### Flow Simulation ‚úÖ
- Complete client-to-backend submission simulation
- Multi-question answer encryption/decryption
- Data integrity and hash verification
- Error handling for various failure scenarios

### Build Verification ‚úÖ
- Backend builds successfully with all changes
- No TypeScript or linting errors
- All dependencies properly installed

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Client Requirements
- Must use synchronized public key from `src/keys/public.pem`
- Must output AES-encrypted data in hex format: `"iv:ciphertext:authTag"`
- Must use RSA OAEP with SHA-256 for key encryption

### Database Schema
- Compatible with existing `ExamSubmission` model
- Stores single combined submission record
- Includes cheat detection analysis results

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The implementation is complete and tested. Key points for deployment:

1. **Keys are synchronized** between client and backend
2. **Encryption/decryption is working** correctly with hex encoding
3. **All tests pass** for compatibility and end-to-end flow
4. **Backend builds successfully** with no errors
5. **API follows established patterns** and error handling

The system is ready to receive and process encrypted offline submissions from the client.
